Machine Learning is a huge topic on the internet and finding good resources can sometimes be tricky. I curated a list of awesome readings and sources, which I enjoyed reading:

1. **Siraj Raval's Youtube Channel**: Siraj Raval is my go to source for learning a concept in AI. I love his way of teaching and you should definitely out.
2. **What if? by Randall Munroe**: This isn't really connected to AI, however it is a book which I always enjoy reading. It combines comics, weird ideas and science in a fascinating way. A really good book and one of my favorites.
3. **The Master Algorithm by Pedro Domingos**: In this book Pedro Domingo explores the different approaches to building the master algorithm (A universal learner). Although I already had quite some experience in AI, I still learned very much from this book. I love this book and would recommend it to anyone. It is written for people with no background in CS and Mathematics and for people who have already spend much time developing ML systems.
