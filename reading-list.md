Machine Learning is a huge topic on the internet and finding good resources can sometimes be tricky. I curated a list of awesome readings, which I enjoyed reading:

1. Siraj Raval's Youtube Channel. \\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siraj Raval is my go to source for learning a concept in AI. I love his way of teaching and you should definitely out
2. What if? by Randall Munroe \\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't really connected to AI, however it is a book which I always enjoy reading in. It combines comics, weird ideas and science in a fascinating way. A really good book and one of my favorites
